    <h1>Lebesgue–Stieltjes Integration</h1>
    
    <h2>General Idea</h2>
    <p>
        Lebesgue–Stieltjes integration is a generalization of the Riemann and Lebesgue integrals. 
        It is used to integrate a function <em>f(x)</em> with respect to another function <em>g(x)</em>, called the <strong>integrator</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        In simpler terms, it allows us to sum up values of <em>f(x)</em> while considering how <em>g(x)</em> changes. 
        This is particularly useful when <em>g(x)</em> is not smooth or has jumps (e.g., a step function).
    </p>
    <p>
        Key features:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>If <em>g(x)</em> is continuous and increasing, this integral behaves like the Riemann integral.</li>
        <li>If <em>g(x)</em> is a step function, the integral reduces to a sum over the steps, which is common in probability theory.</li>
        <li>The integral works even if <em>g(x)</em> has discontinuities or grows in a non-linear way.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Applications in Probability Theory</h2>
    <h3>Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDFs)</h3>
    <p>
        In probability, the CDF <em>F(x)</em> describes how probabilities accumulate. 
        The Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral allows us to compute expected values (or means) by integrating a random variable <em>X</em> with respect to its CDF:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Expected value:</strong> <em>𝔼[X] = ∫ x dF(x)</em>.
    </p>

    <h3>Discrete and Continuous Random Variables</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Discrete Random Variables:</strong> For these, <em>F(x)</em> is a step function, and the integral simplifies to a sum.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Continuous Random Variables:</strong> For these, <em>F(x)</em> is smooth, and the integral behaves like the usual Lebesgue integral.
    </p>

    <h3>Mixed Distributions</h3>
    <p>
        Lebesgue–Stieltjes integration is especially useful for random 
variables with both discrete and continuous components. It handles the 
jumps and continuous parts of <em>F(x)</em> seamlessly.
